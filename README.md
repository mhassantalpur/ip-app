## IP App
A web application that echoes out latitude and longitude information for a given IPv4 address. Implemented using react as my frontend framework. For this excercise, I did not need more than the ability to serve up a static html page with a single route to a function; however, using a framework has advantages in simplifying the code. Geolocation-db api was requested using axios through an external http request.
